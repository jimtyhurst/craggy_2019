## cRaggy is Back - looking at Housing and Evictions in King County

cRaggy, our data exploration and visualization activity is back! For those of you unfamiliar with cRaggy, we make a large dataset available for visualization and analysis, and let you present and share your results, visualizations, and insights about the dataset.

We will looking at a combination of housing data and eviction data for King County, hoping to gain insights about the nature of evictions in King County. This dataset comes courtesy of the planners of the 2019 Symposium for Data Science and Statistics. 

We encourage you to collaborate together and work on visualizations! Our goal is to encourage collaboration, and share our code and insights.

In a month, we'll have a visualization gallery and lightning talks about the visualizations and insights we've come up with. More information to come.

All are welcome. Participation in cRaggy requires agreeing to the [Code of Conduct]()
