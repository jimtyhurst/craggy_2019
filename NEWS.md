# craggy2019 (development version)

* Converted from a simple R project to an [R package](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/package.html). Unfortunately, the repository needed to be renamed from `craggy_2019` to `craggy2019`, in order to conform to the [requirements for a package name](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/package.html#naming). However, developing the project as a package has several advantages:
    - `.Rmd` files are run automatically during the build process to
        produce `html` and `md` files.
    - There is an explicit listing of package dependencies in the `DESCRIPTION` file.
    - The directory structure for data, code, and tests that follows the
        standard conventions used by all R packages.
    - Unit tests can be run automatically as part of the build process.
    - The process is easier for developing reusable code that is accessible within this package or from other projects.
